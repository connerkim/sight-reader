# sight-reader

## What it Does:
### Using ml5.js (a machine learning library with sound recognition training data) and vexflow (a music notation rendering API), this program generates four random notes on a music staff, then takes input from the computer's microphone. The user must sing (or produce with an instrument) the four notes they see in succession. Used for sight-reading and musical instrument practice.

## Why
### This project was initially made to help me learn how to sight-sing (I just joined a choir after being an instrumental musician for most of my life), but also familiarized me with machine learning frameworks and a lot of JS.

## How to Build
### This one is a little trickier. Download the files, then navigate to https://editor.p5js.org/, then replace the default files with the ones of the same name from this repository and run.
